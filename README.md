Exergaming system. A complete gaming system with a console, sensors, firmware and games.

Fitconsole is a game console for exergaming: playing and moving at the same time.

Suitable for exercise games at school, in the gym or at home. For children and adults.

The fit console is a complete system with game console and various sensors to play fitness games. You can make both the console and the sensors yourself because the fit console is 100% open source.

The biggest advantage that fitness games have over traditional forms of exercise is that playing is not only a physical activity, but also a form of entertainment: moving, sweating and smiling all at the same time.

When playing the games you will be challenged to jump and duck. Sensors detect movements such as jumps, squats and boxing movements and the game responds to them.
